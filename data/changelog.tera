<h1>10/16/2023</h1>
<div>
    Un-fixed the "bug" about doubling shares - turns out I just can't read and
    it actually was correct the first time
</div>

<h1>10/15/2023</h1>
<div>
    Made a bunch of updates to the betting website:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Minimum starting pool is 20 (up from 1) - there's some funky math
            stuff that could happen with really low starting pools (e.g. 1) so
            this seems like a more sensible default
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixed a bug where shares in the starting pool were half the amount
            they should have been (e.g. if you put in a starting pool of $10, it
            created 5 yes and 5 no shares, when it should have been 10 and 10)
        </li>
        <li>
            When a bet resolves, the bet creator gets money back based on the
            amount of shares in the starting pool. If the probabilities have not
            changed at all, the creator will get the full amount back. For
            example, you create a bet with $20, which creates 20 yes and 20 no
            shares. You resolve that bet to YES, so you get $20 from the $20 yes
            shares. If the probability changes, then the amount that you get
            back may be more or less than you put in.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This means that the only source of deflation in this economy
                    is now rounding
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Moved to a div-based format instead of a table. It takes up more
            space, but now has a lot more room for other things and is more
            friendly for smaller screens
        </li>
        <li>
            Bets are now sorted by when they were created, then by name. Bets
            created before today don't have a created date
        </li>
        <li>
            Bets now show the creator's name, and if the created date exists,
            they show that too
        </li>
        <li>Also added a new changelog page</li>
    </ul>
</div>
